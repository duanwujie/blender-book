A **mesh **is one of the most important and frequently-used object types in Blender. While there are other types of objects that can be used to model parts of a model or scene \(text, NURBS patches, etc.\), they often get converted to meshes at some point anyway, because it is the object type that offers the greatest amount of detailed control. And as it happens, Blender offers more functions, both built-in and available as addons, for dealing with meshes than for any other object type.

Edit modeis the mode in which you make changes to the internals of theactiveobject. Not every object has an Edit mode \(e.g. cameras\), and the details of what you can do in Edit mode vary between the object types where it is available. This module specifically covers Edit mode for mesh objects.
